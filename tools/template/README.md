# Template

## Description

This tool is just a template for use in creating other tools. It is very basic, but all the files and conventions are followed. A tool developer can create a new tool directory and copy these files into it. Then edit each of the files as appropriate for the tool they are working on.

## Delta

This is just used to trigger the ci-cd for testing.
